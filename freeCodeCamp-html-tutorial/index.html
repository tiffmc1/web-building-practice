				<h3>HTML4 vs HTML5</h3>
				<p>
					HTML5 is the <em>current</em> version of the language recommended for
					use since 2014
				</p>

				<p>It comes with added features such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cleaner code structure and improved semantics</li>
					<li>Simpler DOCTYPE declaration; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
					<li>Cross-browser compatibility</li>
					<li>
						More elements! For example, audio and video tags. HTML4 could not
						support media this way, which led to using third-party browser
						plug-ins, such as Adobe Flash
					</li>
				</ul>

				<aside>
					<details>
						<summary>How does HTML5 benefit the user?</summary>
						<p>
							HTML5 gave the developer more control over the performance of
							their websites. Many “hacks” commonly used in HTML4 are now
							inherent to the language, which allows for a faster and smoother
							user experience

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Think of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) as an address, and the
					desired website as the location. Let's say you're out of food to eat,
					and need to go to the grocery store so you don't starve to death. If
					you want to drive to the store, then you'll need its address. Same
					goes for the web. If you want to get to a website, you'll first need
					its address/URL
				</p>

				<aside>
					<details>
						<summary>
							Why do we use a URL/domain name instead of just entering its IP
							address?
						</summary>
						<p>
							Once you enter any URL, the website will then open with its
							contents. A server is what "serves" it this content. When you
							enter any URL, you are actually entering its IP address of the
							computer responsible for serving (hosting) the website's content
						</p>
						<p>
							Think of your phone's contact list. You can't remember
							<strong>every</strong> phone number in your contact list, but you
							can remember the person's name you wish to call. Same with IP
							addresses. You won't be able to rememeber every IP address but you
							can easily look up its domain name, and the contact list that
							holds all these addresses is known as DNS (Domain Name System)
						</p>
					</details>
				</aside>

				<p>URL Full Journey:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You enter the URL</li>
					<li>
						DNS will provide the corresponding IP address to the URL entered via
						the process below:
						<ol type="I">
							<li>
								<mark>Browser cache is checked first</mark> since a browser will
								maintain its DNS records for some time in case you have visited
								the same website prior. If your browser cache provides
								unfruitful, then a DNS query will run in your operating system's
								(OS) cache followed by the router's cache, which also hold data
								for a period of time
							</li>
							<li>
								If the above step doesn't work, then a DNS query will get help
								from the <mark>DNS Resolver</mark>, which is your ISP (Internet
								Service Provider). The browser looks up the IP address using
								recursive DNS lookup in a very elaborate process, where the
								information is cached many times along the way

								<aside>
									<details>
										<ol type="i">
											<li>
												Request is sent to the top or root server of the DNS
												hierarchy. If you are searching at the TLD (Top Level
												Domain -- .com, .net, .gov, .org), then the Resolver
												Server will ask the TLD Server to provide an IP address
												of the entered domain name
											</li>
											<li>
												Resolver asks TLD to give IP address of the domain name,
												in which TLD answers by caching the address information
											</li>
											<li>
												Next, once cached, TLD tells Resolver to ask
												Authoritative Name Server, which is responsible for
												knowing everything about the domain name
											</li>
											<li>
												Authoritative Name Server provides Resolver with the IP
												address associated with the entered URL and sends it
												back to the browser
											</li>
											<li>
												Resolver stores it in cache so that next time, if the
												same query comes along, then it does not have to go
												through this laborious process again. It can just
												provide it via its cache
											</li>
										</ol>
									</details>
								</aside>
							</li>
							<li>
								Once the IP address is provided, the browser will initiate
								connection via internet protocol.
								<mark>TCP/IP is the most common protocol</mark>, and a
								connection is built between the two using a process called
								<em>TCP 3-Way Handshake</em>
								<aside>
									<details>
										<ol type="i">
											<li>
												Client computer sends a TCP SYN message, asking whether
												the second computer is open for new connection or not
											</li>
											<li>
												Then, another computer, if open for connection, sends an
												acknowledgement message with a TCP SYN message as well
											</li>
											<li>
												The first computer receives its message and acknowledges
												by sending a TCP ACK message
											</li>
											<li>
												NOTE: Above is for HTTP. HTTPS is an encrypted, more
												secure, and more expensive extension of HTTP protocol.
												HTTPS uses the aforementioned process along with a
												certificate check (TLS Handshake), key exchange, and
												secure data tranmission
											</li>
										</ol>
									</details>
								</aside>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						Connection is now built between client and server, and the browser
						now renders the HTTP content. Often times, there are additional
						resources to load such as JavaScript bundles and images. The browser
						repeats the process above in order to fetch all the other resources
					</li>
					<li>
						The client can now send requests to the server for any of the
						content it wants to see. The server knows exactly what response it
						should send (webpage, status-code, cache-control, etc.) and will
						respond back
					</li>

					The input HTML element is used to create interactive controls for
